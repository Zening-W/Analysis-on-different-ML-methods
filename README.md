# Analysis-on-different-ML-methods
This report presents a investigation into the performance of various fundamental machine learning methods across diverse datasets. It aims to assess the effectiveness of these 5 methods: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest and KNN. The 4 datasets chosen are Adult, Wine, Heart, and Iris. By employing a range of datasets with distinct characteristics, the research provides insights into the generalizability and adaptability of each machine learning approach. 
This serves as the final project of COGS118A
